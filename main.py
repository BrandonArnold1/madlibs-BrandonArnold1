STORY
I was [VERB-ING] at the [PLACE] the other day when I heard [CHRISTMAS SONG] come on the radio. I was feeling really [ADJECTIVE] and I’m pretty sure I looked like it because 
[FRIEND'S NAME] walked in and almost [VERB-ED]. Seriously, she [SAME VERB-ED] for close to [AMOUNT OF TIME]! This time every year I [VERB] all the time because I get really 
exciting thinking about holiday [PLURAL NOUN]! That’s why I was sitting at the [SAME PLACE FROM BEFORE]: I was really hoping [RELATIVE'S NAME] would come by and give me at 
least [NUMBER] pieces of holiday [FOOD ITEM]! That didn’t happen, but suddenly [SAME RELATIVE'S NAME] [VERB] by in a huge [NOUN] on wheels dressed up as [CELEBRITY]. I know 
[ADJECTIVE] things happen around the holidays, but this didn’t make any sense! I picked up the phone to call [FRIEND'S NAME], but the phone turned into a big pile of 
[MESSY FOOD] and dripped all the way down to my [BODY PART]! Then my alarm clock went off for about [AMOUNT OF TIME]. It was all a dream! I had a ton of [HOLIDAY FOOD] before 
I went to sleep. Maybe that’s what gave me the crazy dream!
